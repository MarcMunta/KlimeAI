When asked to change code, output a **minimal** patch using fenced blocks in this exact format:

```file:path/to/file.ext
@@
- old line
+ new line
```

Rules:
- Only include files that actually change.
- Keep diffs small and focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- If requirements are unclear, ask 1–3 clarifying questions instead of guessing.
